# darkroom — Command Cheatsheet

Quick reference for the `darkroom` CLI. For the full design brief see `CLAUDE.md`.

```

catalog = the source of truth (astro_catalog.db).  triage = one-off archive cleanup.
```

Run locally with `uv run darkroom <cmd>` (or just `darkroom` if installed globally).

## Shared config resolution

Most path flags resolve in this order: **CLI flag → env var → `darkroom.toml` → default**.
Set the env vars once in your shell and you can omit the flags everywhere.

| Flag | Env var | `darkroom.toml` key | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--catalog` / `--db` | `DARKROOM_CATALOG` | `catalog_path` | `~/.config/darkroom/astro_catalog.db` |
| `--archive` | `DARKROOM_ARCHIVE` | `archive_path` | — (required) |
| `--wbpp` | `DARKROOM_WBPP` | `wbpp_path` | `./WBPP` |
| `--asiair` | — | — | — (required for ingest) |

`darkroom.toml` accepts flat keys or a `[darkroom]` section.

```bash
export DARKROOM_ARCHIVE="/Volumes/Astrophotography"
export DARKROOM_CATALOG="$HOME/.config/darkroom/astro_catalog.db"
export DARKROOM_WBPP="$HOME/WBPP"
```

> **Target names** are forgiving on input — `m81`, `M81`, `M 81` all resolve to the
> canonical `M 81`; `SH2-103`/`Sh 2-103` → `Sh2-103`. Spacing and case are normalised
> for you, so type whatever's convenient.

## The everyday pipeline

### 1. `darkroom ingest` — archive a fresh ASIAir session

Copies FITS off the SD-card copy into the canonical NAS layout and registers the
new sessions + calibration sets in the catalog. **Never deletes source files.**

Designed to be non-interactive (CCC postflight has no TTY): generate a manifest,
eyeball it, then commit.

```bash
# 1. Dry-run: scan and print the manifest to stdout, write nothing
darkroom ingest --asiair /Volumes/ASIAIR/Autorun --dry-run

# 2. Write a manifest to a file so you can review/edit it
darkroom ingest --asiair /Volumes/ASIAIR/Autorun --manifest run.yaml

# 3. (optional) Resolve any needs_review items interactively
darkroom ingest --review run.yaml

# 4. Commit the reviewed manifest (copies files + writes catalog)
darkroom ingest --commit run.yaml

#    …or scan + commit in one shot (no separate manifest file)
darkroom ingest --asiair /Volumes/ASIAIR/Autorun --commit
```

| Flag | Use |
|---|---|
| `--asiair PATH` | ASIAir `Autorun/` folder (the SD-card copy). Required. |
| `--dry-run` | Scan, print manifest to stdout, change nothing. |
| `--manifest FILE` | Scan and write manifest to FILE for review. |
| `--review FILE` | Interactively resolve `needs_review` items in FILE. |
| `--commit [FILE]` | Execute FILE; with no FILE, scan + commit directly. |
| `--archive`, `--catalog` | Override resolved paths. |

The four mode flags (`--dry-run` / `--manifest` / `--review` / `--commit`) are
mutually exclusive — pick one.

Sessions are grouped by **imaging night** (local noon-to-noon), so a run that crosses
midnight stays one session, dated to the night it began.

---

### 2. `darkroom wbpp` — build a WBPP symlink session for PixInsight

Reads the archive + catalog and creates `~/WBPP/<TargetSlug>/SESSION_N/` dirs full of
symlinks (Lights / Darks / Flats / FlatDarks), plus an empty `Output/` to point WBPP at.
One `SESSION_N` per imaging night.

```bash
# Browse what's in the catalog first
darkroom wbpp --list
darkroom wbpp --list --target "M 81"

# Prep every night for a target
darkroom wbpp --target "M 81"

# Prep a single night
darkroom wbpp --target "M 81" --date 2026-02-19

# Prep one exact session by catalog ID
darkroom wbpp --session M81_20260219_FRA400_ZWOASI585MCPro_L-Pro

# Widen/narrow flat matching (default ±3 days)
darkroom wbpp --target "M 81" --flat-window 5

# Rebuild from scratch (clears existing SESSION_N dirs first)
darkroom wbpp --target "M 81" --overwrite
```

| Flag | Use |
|---|---|
| `--list` | List catalog sessions instead of building (optionally `--target`). |
| `--target NAME` | Target to prep (canonicalised; quote names with spaces). |
| `--date YYYY-MM-DD` | Restrict `--target` to one night. |
| `--session ID` | Build one exact session by catalog ID. |
| `--flat-window DAYS` | Match flats within ±DAYS of the session (default 3). |
| `--overwrite` | Clear existing `SESSION_N` dirs before regenerating. Prompts if real (non-symlink) files are present. |
| `--archive`, `--catalog`, `--wbpp` | Override resolved paths. |

**Matching rules:** darks by Camera+Gain+Exposure · flats by OTA+Camera+Filter within
±`--flat-window` days (nearest wins) · flat-darks by flat exposure ±10% on the flat's
date (or +1). If multiple flat sets match, you're prompted (or the closest is auto-picked
when there's no TTY).

After it runs: in PixInsight, add each `SESSION_N/` dir to WBPP and set the output dir to
the printed `Output/` path.

---

### 3. `darkroom finish` — push stacks back and mark processed

After WBPP/PixInsight, copies `Output/master/` + `Output/processed/` into
`<archive>/04_Deep Sky Objects/<target>/_Processed/<date>/` and marks every session under
that WBPP target as processed in the catalog. Then offers to clean up the working dirs.

```bash
# Auto-derives the date from the WBPP output's mtimes
darkroom finish --target "M 81"

# Pin the processed-date folder name explicitly
darkroom finish --target "M 81" --date 2026-05-15

# See what would be copied/deleted without doing it
darkroom finish --target "M 81" --dry-run
```

| Flag | Use |
|---|---|
| `--target NAME` | Required. The WBPP target to finish. |
| `--date YYYY-MM-DD` | Override the auto-derived processing date. |
| `--dry-run` | Print copies/deletes, change nothing. |
| `--archive`, `--catalog`, `--wbpp` | Override resolved paths. |

---

## Catalog management — `darkroom catalog ...`

The catalog is the source of truth. `ingest` writes to it automatically; these commands
are for backfilling, browsing, and manual edits.

> Note: `--db` lives on the **`catalog`** group, before the subcommand:
> `darkroom catalog --db /path/to.db list`.

```bash
# Backfill the catalog by scanning the NAS (idempotent upserts)
darkroom catalog scan-lights "/Volumes/Astrophotography/04_Deep Sky Objects"
darkroom catalog scan-calibration "/Volumes/Astrophotography/00_Calibration"

# Browse
darkroom catalog list
darkroom catalog list --target "M 81"

# Manually set processed_status on one session (date, path, or note)
darkroom catalog mark M81_20260219_FRA400_ZWOASI585MCPro_L-Pro 2026-05-15
```

| Subcommand | When to use |
|---|---|
| `scan-lights <root_path>` | (Re)catalog all light sessions under a folder. Safe to re-run. |
| `scan-calibration <calibration_path>` | (Re)catalog calibration frames (darks/flats/flat-darks/bias). |
| `list [--target NAME]` | Browse sessions, with integration time and processed status. |
| `mark <session_id> <status>` | Manually update one session's `processed_status`. |

### `darkroom catalog migrate-archive` — one-off layout migration

Migrates an old filter-in-folder archive layout to the current `Lights/<filter>/` layout.
You almost certainly won't need this again; keep `--dry-run` until you trust the moves.

```bash
darkroom catalog migrate-archive --archive "/Volumes/Astrophotography" --dry-run
darkroom catalog migrate-archive --archive "/Volumes/Astrophotography"
```

---

## Browsing — `darkroom serve`

Launches datasette on the catalog for ad-hoc SQL/exploration in the browser.

```bash
darkroom serve
darkroom serve --db /path/to/astro_catalog.db
```

---

## Archive cleanup — `darkroom triage ...`

Transient tool for cleaning up the **existing** archive backlog (placeholder FITS
`OBJECT` headers, RA/DEC mismatches, mis-filed calibration, legacy naming). Writes to a
separate `triage.db` — it does **not** touch the catalog. Scaffolding; expected to go away
once the backlog is clean.

```bash
# 1. Walk the archive and flag issues into triage.db
darkroom triage scan --archive "/Volumes/Astrophotography"

# 2. Review/fix flagged items in the web UI (default http://127.0.0.1:8002)
darkroom triage serve --archive "/Volumes/Astrophotography"
darkroom triage serve --archive "/Volumes/Astrophotography" --port 8010
```

| Flag | Use |
|---|---|
| `--archive PATH` | Archive root to scan/serve. Required. |
| `--db PATH` | triage.db location (default `<archive>/triage.db`). |
| `--port` / `--host` | (serve) bind address; default `127.0.0.1:8002`. |

---

## Typical end-to-end run

```bash
# A. New imaging night landed on disk
darkroom ingest --asiair /Volumes/ASIAIR/Autorun --manifest run.yaml
#    review run.yaml, then:
darkroom ingest --commit run.yaml

# B. Stage it for PixInsight
darkroom wbpp --target "M 81" --date 2026-02-19
#    → open the SESSION_N dirs in WBPP, set the Output/ dir, run WBPP + processing

# C. File the results and mark done
darkroom finish --target "M 81"

# Check the books
darkroom catalog list --target "M 81"
```

---

## Gotchas

- **Source is sacred.** `ingest` never deletes SD-card originals — clear them yourself.
- **Filter comes from the filename**, not the FITS header (ASIAir doesn't write FILTER).
- **No TTY in CCC postflight** — keep `ingest` to the manifest → `--commit` flow there.
- **Quote targets with spaces:** `--target "M 81"`. Spacing/case are normalised either way.
- **Flat matching defaults to ±3 days** — bump `--flat-window` if archived flats are older.
